	<h2>BC VC Pilot Credential</h2>
	<p><em>Please <a href="https://vonx.io/getwallet" target="_blank">download a digital wallet</a> before using this service. You must also have test BC Services Mobile app data. If you need that, please contact [details TBD].</em></p>
	<p>This is a Proof of Concept service operated for the purposes of the Business Banking Initiative. It demonstrates how an individual can receive a verifiable credential issued by an authority (the Government of BC) containing information that authority knows about you. That information matches exactly the information that you might see on a BC Services Card.</p>
	<p>To receive your verified person credential you must first identify yourself in the service. The test BC Services Mobile app is used to do that for this service. When you proceed you will be asked for your BC Services Mobile app test account. Provide that, information will be collected about you from the BC Services card app, and then that same data will be offered to you as a verifiable credential.</p>
	<p>When the QR code to receive your digital credential is displayed, use your digital wallet app (you have one right? If not, please <a href="https://vonx.io/getwallet" target="_blank">download a digital wallet</a>) to scan the code and follow the instructions in your wallet app.</p>
